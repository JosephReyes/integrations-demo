## What is it?
A spike written at work that I thought to save as my own personal React and AWS CDK playground

## Important notes
* It was a spike, so it is NOT production ready
* With that said I will add tests eventually
* I do consider it a playground, so I will keep adding cool things I want to try

## How to run
1. Clone repo
2. `cd integrations-demo-app`
3. `npm start`

At the moment it is connected to a stack in my personal AWS account

You can also deploy your own backend service CDK in the `./integrations-service` folder
